My fascination with space began in childhood and found its first creative outlet in 2017 when I started capturing landscape astrophotography. In 2021, I acquired my first telescope, which opened the door to deep-sky astrophotography. All the images featured here were captured during my time under Wyoming's pristine dark skies. While I now call Indianapolis home with my wife and dog, and am on a temporary hiatus from imaging, I look forward to continuing this journey through future remote observatory work.
